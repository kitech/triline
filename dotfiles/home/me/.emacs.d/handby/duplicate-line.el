; 
; Here's a couple of commands I find indispensible; they might as well
; see the light of day now, while I'm thinking of them.  I bind them
; thus:
; 
; (global-set-key "\M-p" 'duplicate-previous-line)
; (global-set-key "\M-n" 'duplicate-following-line)
; 
; and they behave in ordinary text buffers something like the same keys
; do in buffers with history, duplicating lines from nearby in the
; buffer.
; 
; I included my `point-at' macro rather than expanding it out by hand.
; 
; Copyright notice included even though I doubt it's needed on something
; so small.
